    <p>In a recent Number of the MIRROR we offered ourselves as the reader's
    <i>cicerone</i> throughout the interior of this stupendous building, the exterior of
    which is represented in the annexed engraving; and the architectural pretensions of
    which will, we trust, be found of equal interest to the interior.</p>

    <p>The Colosseum is what is termed a polygon of sixteen sides, 130 feet in diameter.
    Each angle is strengthened by a double square pilaster of the Doric order, which
    supports an entablature, continued round the whole edifice. Above the cornice is a
    blocking course, surmounted by an attic, with an appropriate cornice and
    sub-blocking, to add to the height of the building. The whole is crowned with a
    majestic cupola, supported by three receding <i>scamilli</i>, or steps, and finished
    with an immense open circle. The upper part of the cupola is glazed, and protected
    with fine wire-work, and the lower part is covered with sheet copper; which
    distinctions are shown in the engraving.</p>

    <p>When the spectator's surprise and admiration at the vastness of the building have
    somewhat subsided, his attention will be drawn to the fine and harmonious proportions
    of the portico, considered by architects as one of the best specimens of Graeco-Doric
    in the metropolis. This portion of the building is copied from the portico of the
    Pantheon at Rome, "which, in the harmony of its proportions, and the exquisite beauty
    of its columns, surpasses every temple on the earth." Altogether, the grandeur and
    effect of this vast structure should be seen to be duly appreciated.</p>

    <p>The adjoining lodges are in exceedingly good taste; and the plantations laid out
    by Mr. Hornor, are equally pleasing, whilst their verdure relieves the massiveness of
    the building; and in the engraving, the artist has caught a glimpse of the
    lattice-work which encloses the gardens and conservatories attached to the splendid
    suite of rooms. The front is enclosed by handsome iron rails, tastefully painted in
    imitation of bronze. We ought also to mention, that the means by which the portico is
    made to resemble immense blocks of stone, is peculiarly successful.</p>

    <p>The architect of this extraordinary building is Mr. Decimus Burton, aided by his
    ingenious employer, Mr. Hornor, of whose taste and talents we have already spoken in
    terms of high commendation. Its original name, or, we should say, its popular name,
    was the <i>Coliseum</i>, evidently a misnomer, from its distant resemblance to that
    gigantic work of antiquity. The present and more appropriate name is the COLOSSEUM,
    in allusion to its colossal dimensions; for it would not show much discernment to
    erect a building like the Pantheon, and call it the Coliseum. The term <i>Diorama</i>
    has, likewise, been strangely corrupted since its successful adoption in the Regent's
    Park&mdash;it being now almost indefinitely applied to any number or description of
    paintings.</p>

    <h3>SNEEZING AMONG THE ANCIENTS.</h3>

    <h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>Among the Greeks, sneezing was reckoned a good omen. The practice of saluting the
    person who sneezed, existed in Africa, among nations unknown to the Greeks and
    Romans. Brown, in his "Vulgar Errors," says, "We read in Godignus, that, upon a
    sneeze of the emperor of Monumotata, there passed acclamations successively through
    the city." The author of the "Conquest of Peru" assures us, that the cacique of
    Guachoia having sneezed in the presence of the Spaniards, the Indians of his train
    fell prostrate before him, stretched forth their hands, and displayed to him the
    accustomed marks of respect, while they invoked the sun to enlighten him, to defend
    him, and to be his constant guard. The Romans saluted each other on sneezing.
    Plutarch tells us, the genius of Socrates informed him by sneezing, when it was
    necessary to perform any action. The young Parthenis, hurried on by her passions,
    resolved to write to Sarpedon an avowal of her love: she sneezes in the most tender
    and impassioned part of her letter. This is sufficient for her; this incident
    supplies the place of an answer, and persuades her that Sarpedon is her lover. In the
    Odyssey, we are informed that Penelope, harassed by the vexatious courtship of her
    suitors, begins to curse them all, and to pour forth vows for the return of Ulysses.
    Her son Telemachus interrupts her by a loud sneeze. She instantly exults with joy,
    and regards this sign as an assurance of the approaching return of her husband.
    Xenophon was haranguing his troops; when a soldier sneezed in the moment he was
    exhorting them to embrace a dangerous but necessary resolution. The whole army, moved
    by this presage, determined to pursue the project of their general; and Xenophon
    orders sacrifices to Jupiter, the preserver. This religious reverence for sneezing,
    so ancient and so universal even in the time of Homer, always excited the curiosity
    of the Greek philosophers and the rabbins. These last spread a tradition, that, after
    the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> creation of
    the world, God made a law to this purport, that every man should sneeze but once in
    his life, and that at the same instant he should render up his soul into the hands of
    his Creator, without any preceding indisposition. Jacob obtained an exemption from
    the common law, and the favour of being informed of his last hour. He sneezed, and
    did not die; and this sign of death was changed into a sign of life. Notice of this
    was sent to all the princes of the earth; and they ordained, that in future sneezing
    should be accompanied with <i>forms of blessings</i>, and vows for the persons who
    sneezed. Thus the custom of <i>blessing persons who sneeze</i> is of higher antiquity
    than some authors suppose, for several writers affirm that it commenced in the year
    750, under Pope Gregory the Great, when a pestilence occurred in which those who
    sneezed died; whence the pontiff appointed a form of prayer, and a wish to be said to
    persons sneezing, for averting this fatality from them. Some say Prometheus was the
    first that wished well to sneezers. For further information on this <i>ticklish</i>
    subject, I refer the reader to Brand's "Observations on Popular Antiquities."</p>

    <h3>BOOK-MACHINERY.</h3>

    <h4><i>(To the Editor of the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>The world being supplied with books by <i>machinery</i> is almost, literally, a
    fact. Type-founding and stereotyping are, of course, mechanical processes; and
    lately, Dr. Church, of Boston, invented a plan for <i>composing</i> (setting the
    types) by machinery; the sheets are printed by steam; the paper is made by machinery;
    and pressed and beaten for binding by a machine of very recent date. Little more
    remains to be done than to write by machinery; and, to judge by many recent
    productions, a <i>spinning-jenny</i> would be the best engine for this purpose.</p>

    <p>PHILO.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>GRAVITATION.</h3>

    <h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>In a matter-of-fact age like the present, methinks it behoves every man to apply
    the improvements of scientific research as much as possible to the ordinary concerns
    of life. Science and society may thus be called <i>at par</i>, and philosophical
    theory will hence enlighten the practical tradesman.</p>

    <p>To demonstrate the truth of the above remarks, I mean, with the editor's leave, to
    prove the necessity of keeping a friend in one's pocket, upon the principles of
    gravitation, according to Sir Isaac Newton's "Principia."</p>

    <p>The learned doctor has mathematically proved that all bodies gravitate or incline
    to the centre. It is on this principle only that we can account for our being fixed
    to the earth; that we are surrounded by the atmosphere; and that we are constantly
    attended by, and seem constantly to attend, the planets around us.</p>

    <p>Should any farther demonstration be necessary than the incomparable Sir Isaac has
    himself furnished us with, let any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68"
    name="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> sceptic who doubts that the earth attracts all
    smaller bodies towards its centre, only take a hop from the Monument or St. Paul's,
    and he will soon find the power of gravitation, and die by the truth of the
    experiment.</p>

    <p>But what, methinks, exclaims the reader, has all this to do with the proposition
    in hand, viz. the necessity of keeping a friend in one's pocket? Why, I'll tell
    you&mdash;from a due consideration of this very principle, you will soon see the use
    of a man's keeping his <i>money</i> in his pocket. It is this alone (the pocket)
    which nowadays constitutes the centre of friendship; there alone, therefore, must
    this most valuable, most faithful of all friends (<i>money</i>) be deposited. Now if
    this friend be of magnitude, he will soon collect many more around you, who, true as
    the needle to the pole, will point to you from every quarter&mdash;friends who will
    smile in your prosperity, bask in the sunshine of your glory, dance while you pay the
    piper, and to the very ground will be "votre tr&egrave;s humble serviteur, monsieur."
    But if by sickness, misfortune, generosity, or the like, this friend be removed from
    your pocket, the centre is destroyed, the equilibrium is lost, away fly your friends,
    and, like pelicans, turn their beaks at your breast whenever you approach. "It is
    your own fault, fellow; you might have done well if you would; but you are an ass,
    and could not keep a friend when you had him; and so you may die in a ditch, and go
    to the devil, my dear."</p>

    <p>The man of affluence, who lavishes away his substance, may aptly enough be likened
    to a porpoise sporting in the ocean&mdash;the smaller fry play around him, admire his
    dexterity, fan his follies, glory in his gambols; but let him once be enmeshed in the
    net of misfortune, and they who foremost fawned under his fins, will first fall foul
    of him.</p>

    <p>Now, to illustrate the subject further, let us consider the advantages arising
    from this practical use of gravitation, and the losses attendant upon the neglect
    thereof. First, then, he who <i>has</i> secured this friend in his pocket, may go
    <i>when</i> he pleases, and <i>where</i> he pleases, and <i>how</i> he pleases,
    either on foot or on horseback, by barouche or by boat, and he shall be respected and
    esteemed, and called <i>sir</i>, and made welcome in every season and in every place,
    and no one shall presume to say unto him, Why doest thou these things?</p>

    <p>But a man that hath not this friend in his pocket, may not go when, where, and how
    he pleases, but when, where, and how he is directed by others. Moreover he shall
    travel on foot, and perchance without shoes, and not have the benefit of a horse,
    barouche, or boat; and moreover he shall be called <i>sirrah</i>, and not <i>sir</i>;
    neither shall he be esteemed nor respected, nor made welcome; and they shall say unto
    him, "Don't be troublesome, fellow; get out of the way, for thou hast no business
    here!"</p>

    <p>The rich man shall be clothed in scarlet, and get whatsoever his heart desires;
    and the people shall give him the wall, and bow before him to the ground. But the
    poor man shall be clad in rags, and walk in the dirt, regarded by no man; nor shall
    he even purchase to himself a name, though the composition thereof consist only of
    air!</p>

    <p>This is the state of modern times&mdash;such our modern friendship; and since,
    gentle reader, it is so, who, possessing one grain of common sense, would not duly
    attend to the theory of gravitation, by taking care of a friend while he has him,
    especially if he be so portable as to be placed in one's pocket.</p>

    <h3>ANCIENT SITE OF THE EXETER 'CHANGE, &amp;c.</h3>

    <h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>Here was formerly the parsonage-house for the parish of St. Clement Danes, with a
    garden and close for the parson's horse, till Sir Thomas Palmer, knight, in the reign
    of Edward VI., came into the possession of the living, and began to build a house;
    but upon his attainder for high treason, in the first year of Queen Mary, it reverted
    to the crown. This house remained in the crown till Queen Elizabeth granted it to Sir
    William Cecil, lord treasurer, who augmented and rebuilt it, when it was called Cecil
    House, and Burleigh House. It was said to have been a noble pile, and adorned with
    four square turrets. It was afterwards called Exeter House, from the title of his son
    and successor. Lord Burleigh died here in 1598. It fronted the Strand, and its
    gardens extended from the west side of the garden-wall of Wimbledon House to the
    Green-lane, which is now Southampton-street. Lord Burleigh was in this house honoured
    by a visit from Queen Elizabeth, who, knowing him to be subject to the gout, would
    always make him to sit in her presence, which, it is probable, (says Nightingale,)
    the lord treasurer considered a gteal indulgence from so haughty a lady, inasmuch as
    he one day apologized for the badness of his legs. To which the queen replied, "My
    lord, we make use of you not for the badness of your legs, but for the goodness of
    your head." When she came to Burleigh House, it is probable she had that kind of
    pyramidial head-dress then in fashion, built of wire, lace, ribands, and jewels,
    which shot up to a great height; for when the principal domestic ushered her in, as
    she passed the threshold he desired her majesty to stoop. To which she replied, "For
    your master's sake I will stoop, but not for the king of Spain." After the fire of
    London, this house was occupied by the doctors of civil law, &amp;c. till 1672; and
    here the various courts of arches, admiralty, &amp;c. were kept. Being deserted by
    the family, the lower part was converted into shops of various descriptions; the
    upper part, like Babylon of old, is a nest of wild beasts, birds, and reptiles. The
    present "march of intellect" will <i>march away</i> these bipeds and quadrupeds, and
    no doubt the noble Marquess of Exeter "would much rather have their <i>room</i> than
    their <i>company</i>."</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>A DAY AT FONTAINBLEAU.&mdash;THE ROYAL HUNT.</h3>

    <p>Having learned that the King and the Dauphin, with the <i>Duc de Grammont</i> ,and
    the rest of the royal suite, were about to proceed to Fontainbleau, in order to enjoy
    the diversion of hunting, I resolved to be there to meet them, to see with my own
    eyes a royal personage of whom I had heard so much. Accordingly I ordered post
    horses, and arrived in the town about six hours after his Most Christian Majesty.</p>

    <p>After breakfasting on a cold partridge and some excellent coffee, I set out at
    eight o'clock for the forest. Even at that hour&mdash;a late one in France, when
    compared with England&mdash;the roads were by no means thronged, and I could very
    plainly perceive that the major part of the equestrians were attached to the court,
    and that the pedestrians were either such as had been in the enjoyment of some of the
    good things of this life under the present family, or such as were in expectancy of
    them. There was a third class, altogether composed of the mob, who, partly incited by
    the desire of plunder, the love of idleness, or an indistinct hope of obtaining the
    entrails of the deer, flocked in great numbers to witness the feats of the royal
    party. Among this latter class, old men, old women, and very young boys
    predominated.</p>

    <p>The forest of Fontainbleau is in itself beautiful in the extreme. The various
    alleys formed by the manner in which the oak trees are planted, create an imposing
    and majestic <i>coup d'oeil</i>, which is only bounded almost by the horizon. At the
    bottom and in the middle of these alleys were placed mounted <i>gendarmes</i> to
    restrain the intrusion of the populace, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page70"
    name="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> to prevent them from coming&mdash;such is French
    curiosity&mdash;within shot of the hunters. At the end of one of these alleys, to my
    left, the great body of the crowd was stationed, and at the top of it was an enclosed
    space, somewhat like a stand on a race course, on which the royal party took their
    station, while the carriages and servants remained quietly behind. Across this stand,
    and within the enclosed space, were the roe-buck, fawns, and young wild boar goaded,
    while the King, the Dauphin, the Duc de Grammont, and the rest of the royal party,
    had their shots in succession, or, as it is technically termed, their "<i>coup</i>."
    Ten men were busy charging for the King, while as many were engaged for the Dauphin.
    Ammunition and cartridges were borne by four attendants, who, as well as the
    chargers, were all in the livery of the King's huntsmen. As shot after shot passed in
    quick succession, the sounds fell chiefly on the ears of those among the
    crowd&mdash;and they were the fewer number&mdash;who had hearts within them, and to
    British feeling each reverberation brought a mingled sensation. In England, and in
    most other nations, whether civilized or savage, when an animal is hunted, some
    chance at least of escape is given. The reader will bear in mind that the enclosed
    space around the stand was surrounded by a kind of <i>chevaux de frize</i>, six feet
    in height, so that the animal had not the least chance of escape, and the work of
    destruction of course went rapidly on.</p>

    <p>Within 300 yards of the stand were placed a number of light carts, whose drivers
    vociferated loudly at the sound of each shot. These carts were placed for the purpose
    of carrying away the dead carcasses, as they accumulated in quick succession within
    the enclosure. In the short interval of four hours I saw twenty-three of these carts
    filled with the produce of the slaughter, which, amidst deafening yells, was conveyed
    to the end of one of the alleys, where the bodies were deposited in order as they had
    been killed. In the first row those killed by the king himself were ranged; and he
    numbered forty-six roe-bucks, and one <i>marcassin</i> (young wild boar;) the spoil
    of the dauphin was thirty-eight roe-bucks, being eight less than his royal father,
    while the rest of the company destroyed among them fifty-four, making a grand total
    of 138 roes, and one wild boar.</p>

    <p>While the carcasses thus remained strewn on the ground, the work of disembowelling
    quickly proceeded. It was the business of one man to range the game in the order I
    have mentioned&mdash;another ripped open the body with a sharp knife, while a third
    party, to the amount of a dozen, were engaged in the disembowelling.</p>

    <p>The day, which hitherto was bright and glorious, now began to close into evening.
    The air became keener, and I felt a disposition to leave the forest and return to
    Fontainbleau. But, though I had heard the king, I had not yet seen him, and my party
    being anxious to come in contact with royalty, I consented to remain. Presently the
    crowd began to rush towards the enclosed space, but the gendarmes, ever active, kept
    them at bay. The multitude, however, despite opposition, ranged themselves into two
    lines; and, in a few minutes, the signal ran that the king was coming.</p>

    <p>His majesty was on foot&mdash;he was surrounded by the officers of his household,
    dressed in a plain, dark-green frock, with a star on his breast. On his head was a
    small, round, gray hat, full of days, or mayhap years, and of services. His breeches
    were of the homeliest thickset; and he also wore a pair of large leather
    gaiters&mdash;such as are very common among farmers and peasants in Kent and Sussex.
    Though the conformation of his figure was not powerful, yet it was muscular and wiry,
    and he appeared in perfect health.</p>

    <p>It was now past five o'clock, and the umbrage of the forest added a deeper tint to
    the shadows of evening. The air was piercingly cold, and his majesty had been engaged
    in the sport from six in the morning, without intermission. Untired, however, in the
    work, the king determined to continue the sport, and accordingly, with his suite, he
    returned to the enclosed space. In the enclosure his majesty did not long remain.
    Three separate bevies of deer were let loose&mdash;again I heard the fearful shots,
    and the number was soon filled up. The king again came among the crowd; and, after
    having given directions about the game, entered his carriage with a hasty step, and
    at a rapid pace drove off for Fontainbleau.</p>

    <h2>THE CONTEMPORARY TRAVELLER.</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>LAKE ERIE.</h3>

    <p>Lake Erie has few of the fascinations of scenery to boast of, apart from the large
    mass of waters it exhibits&mdash;in tranquillity, or in motion, sometimes most
    vehement. It is only at its west end that it is adorned by islands. The Morasses,
    earthy scaurs, or gentle uplands of its coasts, are only remarkable for their large
    walnut and buttonwood trees, which, in a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page71"
    name="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> dense umbrageous belt, shut out all view of the
    interior from the traveller on the lake, except at the partial clearances. Neither is
    the vicinity of this lake agreeable as a residence, in the western half, at least in
    the summer. The heat then, although not thermometrically extreme, is peculiarly
    oppressive, relaxing, and long continued. The steaming swamps, which are almost
    universal, are full of putrifying substances, occasioning the bilious remittents
    there so prevalent. The water in common use is heated, and ill-tasted. Moskitoes,
    sand, and black flies abound, and, extending their attacks to the domestic animals,
    aided by a fly nearly an inch long, almost drive them distracted. There are
    circumstances also, in social life, which render this region a disagreeable
    residence, but which are gradually disappearing. Its extreme fertility, the moderate
    sum of its annual heat, and its facilities of communication with other countries,
    will, in progress of time, render it the seat of a dense population, and a principal
    granary of the western continent. Wheat, maize, and tobacco, are cultivated with
    equal success. The returns of the agriculturist are large, secure, and of excellent
    quality. The last-named article has been grown in considerable quantity about the
    river Detroit, near the head of the lake, and favoured, in a small remission of duty,
    by the British government, is sent to England, after having undergone an inland
    carriage, to Quebec, of 814 miles. Salt springs exist in almost every township,
    accompanied, in one or two cases, by large beds of gypsum. Bog iron ore is common on
    the north-east side of the lake, and is worked. The water communications of these
    countries are astonishingly easy. Canoes can go from Quebec to Rocky Mountains, to
    the Arctic Circle, or to the Mexican Gulf, without a portage longer than four miles;
    and the traveller shall arrive at his journey's end as fresh and as safely as from an
    English tour of pleasure. It is common for the Erie steam-boat to take goods and
    passengers from Buffaloe, to Green Bay and Chicago, in Lake Michigan, a distance of
    nearly 900 miles, touching, at the same time, at many intermediate ports. In about
    three years, in addition to the canal connecting Lake Erie with tide-water in the
    Hudson, another will be excavated across the southern dividing ridge, to communicate
    with the Ohio. Near its place of junction with this river, a canal from the Atlantic,
    across the Alleghanies, will enter the Ohio. Lake Erie will then also have a steady
    line of water transport to Baltimore, on the Chesapeake, and New Orleans, on the
    Mississippi. The surveys, preparatory to these projects, have been in execution for
    two years; there is no doubt of their practicability.</p>

    <p>We cannot even hazard a conjecture as to the number of inhabitants around Lake
    Erie. They are numerous, and daily augmenting; but with incomparably greater rapidity
    on the south side of the lake, distributed between the States of New York,
    Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Ohio, which occupies the largest portion, in 1800, had 45,000
    inhabitants; in 1810, 250,760, and, in 1820, 581,434. At present, it cannot have less
    than 750,000 inhabitants, and there is ample room for more. There are few or no
    Indians on the north borders of the lake. The Mohawks are placed high up the river
    Ouse, and the Hurons, from four to ten miles up the river Detroit.</p>

    <p>The winds are generally either up or down the lake, and in summer they are in the
    former direction for two-thirds of the time. In the middle of this season they are
    commonly mild, but occasionally in perfect tornadoes, accompanied with tremendous
    lightning and heavy rain. The gales begin in October, and are both violent and
    dangerous. Many lives are lost annually. The winters are mild and short. The
    inhabitants do not reckon on the ground being covered by snow more than three or four
    months. They turn their cattle into the woods in March and April, but the lake
    remains full of floating ice until May. On the 12th of May, 1821, the steam-boat
    could not proceed on account of the ice. From an adjacent eminence, the lake was seen
    to be covered with it in one compact mass, as far as the eye could range. As might be
    expected, remittent and intermittent fevers are very prevalent in the autumn. The
    febrile action rises high, and there is usually a topical affection conjoined; to
    this the stimulating diet and frequent use of spirituous liquors, and exposure to
    heat, mainly conduce.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3><i>Hydrophobia in Foxes.</i></h3>

    <p>Foxes become mad occasionally, and there have been examples of dogs, which having
    been bitten by mad foxes, have not caught the disease. In these cases it has been
    proved that the stomachs of the foxes were filled with wood, earth, stones, leaves,
    hair, and other substances improper for nourishment. On the contrary, when the
    madness has been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>[pg
    72]</span> communicated, the stomach and intestines have been found completely empty.
    From this difference, it is concluded that hunger is the cause of madness in foxes;
    and this agrees with the results which occurred during and after the rigorous winter
    of 1826-7, when these animals, with many others, suffered from want of
    nourishment.&mdash;<i>From the French.</i></p>
    <hr />

    <h3><i>Ripening Fruit.</i></h3>

    <p>Slates have recently been employed in France for hastening the ripening of fruits.
    The effect was first observed on a slate roof; since which the slates have been
    placed beneath the fruit on walls.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3><i>Hatching Eggs by Hot Mineral Waters.</i></h3>

    <p>This curious process has lately been practised with great success in the south of
    France. It consists in putting the eggs into a small basket, suspending the latter in
    a stove heated by the hot mineral water, and turning the eggs every day. The first
    trial was attended with success, and no failure was experienced in four repetitions
    of it.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3><i>Lake Erie.</i></h3>

    <p>The height of Lake Erie above the Atlantic Ocean, has been ascertained to be 565
    feet. The barrier which contains it is so low, that, were it only to rise six feet,
    it would inundate, on its northern and western borders, seven millions of acres, now
    partly occupied by towns, villages, and farms; and it is estimated that a further
    rise of six or eight feet would precipitate a vast flood of waters over the state of
    Illinois, from the south end of Michigan; the great Canadian Lakes then discharging
    also into the Mexican Gulf.&mdash;<i>Brande's Journal.</i></p>

    <h3><i>The Cuckoo</i></h3>

    <p>Has done more for our music than musicians may be willing to allow; but it is no
    more than justice to a despised bird to say, that from it we have derived the minor
    scale, whose origin has puzzled so many; the cuckoo's couplet being the minor third
    sung downwards.&mdash;<i>Mag. Nat. Hist.</i></p>

    <h3><i>Immense Fir-tree.</i></h3>

    <p>In the Museum of Natural History at Strasburg, is shown the trunk of a silver
    fir-tree, from the forest of Hochwald, at Barr, in Alsatia. The tree was 150 feet
    high, with a trunk perfectly straight and free from branches to the height of 50
    feet, after which it was forked with the one shoot 100 feet long, and the other
    somewhat shorter. The diameter of the trunk at the surface of the ground was 8 feet;
    estimated age 350 years.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>
    <hr />

    <h3><i>The Weather by Frogs.</i></h3>

    <p>The editor of the <i>Magazine of Natural History</i>, in his Notes during a recent
    tour on the continent, says, "at Schwetzingen, in the post-house, we witnessed, for
    the first time, what we have since seen frequently, an amusing application of
    zoological knowledge, for the purpose of prognosticating the weather. Two frogs, of
    the species <i>R</i>&agrave;na arb&ograve;rea, are kept in a crystal jar, about 18
    inches high, and 6 inches in diameter, with a depth of three or four inches of water
    at the bottom, and a small ladder reaching to the top of the jar. On the approach of
    dry weather, the frogs mount the ladder; but, when moisture is expected, they descend
    into the water. These animals are of a bright green, and in their wild state here,
    climb the trees in search of insects, and make a peculiar singing noise before rain.
    In the jar they get no other food than now and then a fly; one of which, we were
    assured, would serve a frog for a week, though it will eat from six to twelve in a
    day if it can get them. In catching the flies put alive into the jar the frogs
    display great adroitness."</p>
    <hr />

    <h3><i>Human Remains.</i></h3>

    <p>The remarkable fact, that no vestiges of human remains have been discovered with
    those of the more ancient inhabitants of the globe, is at present fully confirmed;
    nor have any fossil bones of monkeys hitherto been found. Mr. Bakewell, however,
    observes, that the vast diluvial beds of gravel and clay, and the upper strata in
    Asia, have not yet been scientifically explored; and both sacred and profane writers
    agree in regarding the temperate regions of that continent as the cradle of the human
    race.&mdash;<i>Bakewell's Geology.</i></p>
    <hr />

    <h3><i>Food of Bees.</i></h3>

    <p>The American black willow and the red maple, are the first trees that are visited
    by bees. They are fond of the crocus, which is the earliest of our bulbous roots. The
    stercorary and piggery are next resorted to by these insects, and the extract
    absorbed from them must be used as a tonic. Blossoms of all kinds, excepting those of
    the red clover and of the honeysuckle, are excellent food; and the bees especially
    profit by the increased attention bestowed at present on the cultivation of the
    peach-tree in some parts of America. They not only drink the nectar and abstract the
    pollen of the flower, but they appropriate the peach itself. We have seen twenty or
    thirty bees devour a peach in half an hour; that is, they carried the juices of it to
    their cells. The humming-bird alone can reach the <span class="pagenum"><a
    id="page73" name="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> bottom of the nectary of the
    honeysuckle; but even here the instinct of the bee is seen. The small birds, such as
    the wren, make an incision on the outside, near the bottom of the flower, and extract
    a part of the juices. The bee takes advantage of this opening, and avails itself of
    what is left. The scent of bees is so acute, that every flower which has a powerful
    odour can be discovered by them at a great distance. Strawberry blossoms, mignonette,
    wild and garden thyme, herbs of all kinds, apple, plum, cherry, and above all,
    raspberry blossoms and white clover, are delicious food for them, and a thriving
    orchard and apiary fitly go together.</p>

    <h3><i>Singing Birds.</i></h3>

    <p>Those who have paid attention to the singing of birds, know well that their voice,
    energy, and expression differ as widely as in man; and agreeably to this remark, Mr.
    Wilson (the celebrated ornithologist) says he was so familiar with the notes of an
    individual wood thrush, that he could recognise him from all his fellows the moment
    he entered the woods.</p>

    <h3><i>Gigantic Fossils.</i></h3>

    <p>Some gigantic bones have been exhibited at New Orleans, but the place where they
    were found is not mentioned in the communication. They consist of one of the bones of
    the cranium, fifteen or twenty vertebras, two entire ribs, and part of a third, one
    thigh bone, two bones of the leg, &amp;c. The cranial bone was upwards of twenty feet
    in its greatest length, about four in extreme width, and it weighed 1,200 lbs. The
    ribs measured nine feet along the curve, and about three inches in thickness. It had
    been conjectured that the animal to which these bones belonged was amphibious, and
    perhaps of the crocodile family. It was also supposed that the animal when alive,
    must have measured twenty-five feet round the body, and about 130 feet in length.</p>

    <h3><i>The Cochineal Insect.</i></h3>

    <p>Our readers are doubtless aware that cochineal, so extensively used in this
    country for dying,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a
    href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a beautiful insect abundantly found in various
    parts of Mexico and Peru. Some of these insects have lately been sent over to Old
    Spain, and are doing remarkably well on the prickly pear of that country; indeed,
    they are said to rival even those of Mexico in the quality and brilliancy of their
    dye.</p>

    <p>Their naturalization may doubtless be extended along the shores of the
    Mediterranean, Sicily, and the different states of Greece. The prickly pear is
    indigenous in those places, and by little cultivation will afford sufficient
    nourishment for the cochineal insects. We are also assured, (says an intelligent
    correspondent of <i>The Times</i>,) that these precious insects were introduced last
    year on the island of Malta, by Dr. Gorman, on account of the government, and that
    they are likely to do well on that island.</p>

    <p>Dr. Gorman discovered a few weeks since, in the botanic garden at Cambridge, the
    <i>grona sylvestris</i>, or wild species of cochineal, living among the leaves of the
    coffee-plants, the acacia, &amp;c. This is the kermes, or gronilla of Spain, about
    which so much has been said in endeavouring to identify it with the grona fina. At
    all events, this is the same species as the gronilla found on the hairs of the green
    oaks in Andalusia; and in some years large and valuable crops of the gronilla are
    gathered in that part of Spain by the peasantry, and sold to the Moors to dye their
    scarlet.</p>

    <p>The gardener at Cambridge could not inform Dr. Gorman how long the insects had
    been there, or from whence they came, but they went there by the appellation of
    "amelca bug." The gardener found these insects very destructive to plants upon which
    they fostered, and although he tried every means short of injuring the plants to
    remove them, he found it impossible, as they adhere to the leaves and parts of the
    stem with such tenacity, and are so prolific, that the young ones are often found
    spreading themselves over the neighbouring plants. On this account, it would be worth
    while to attempt the cultivation of the prickly pear in the open air in this country,
    and place the insects upon them, for in all probability the insects would, by good
    management, do well.</p>

    <h3><i>Fossil Turtle.</i></h3>

    <p>The remains of a sea turtle have lately been discovered, and are now in the
    possession of Mr. Deck, of Cambridge. It is imbedded in a mass of septaria, weighing
    upwards of 150 pounds, with two fine specimens of fossil wood; and was obtained in
    digging for cement stone, about five miles from Harwich, in three fathoms water,
    where, as a mass of stone, it had been used for some time as a stepping
    block.&mdash;<i>Bakewell's Geology.</i></p>

    <p>The following are the writers whose opinions have obtained the greatest celebrity,
    as advocates for particular systems <span class="pagenum"><a id="page74"
    name="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> accounting for the formation and subsequent
    alteration of the earth:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Mr. Whitehurst taught that the <i>concentric arrangement</i> of the crust of the
    globe was destroyed by the expansive force of subterranean fire.</p>

    <p>Burnet's theory supposes this crust to have been broken for the production of the
    deluge.</p>

    <p>Leibnitz and Buffon believed the earth to have been liquefied by fire; in fact,
    that it is an extinguished sun or vitrified globe, whose surface has been operated
    upon by a deluge. The latter assumes that the earth was 75,000 years in cooling to
    its present temperature, and that, in 98,000 years more, productive nature must be
    finally extinguished.</p>

    <p>Woodward considered there was a temporary dissolution of the elements of the
    globe, during which period the extraneous fossils became incorporated with the
    general mass.</p>

    <p>De Luc, Dolomieu, and, finally Baron Cuvier, unite in the opinion, that the
    phenomena exhibited by the earth, particularly the alternate deposits of terrestrial
    and marine productions, can only be satisfactorily accounted for by a series of
    revolutions similar to the deluge.</p>

    <p>Among the singular views entertained by men of genius, in the infancy of the
    science, are those of Whiston, "who fancied that the earth was created from the
    atmosphere of one comet, and deluged by the tail of another;" and that, for their
    sins, the antediluvian population were drowned; "except the fishes, whose passions
    were less violent."</p>

    <p>A French geologist conceived that the sea covered the earth for a vast period;
    that all animals were originally inhabitants of the water; that their habits
    gradually changed on the retiring of the waves, and "that man himself began his
    career as a fish!"&mdash;<i>Mag. Nat. Hist.</i></p>

    <h3>THE CLIFFORDS OF CRAVEN.</h3>

    <p>There is no district in England which abounds in more beautiful and romantic
    scenery than the remote and rarely visited district of Craven, in Yorkshire. Its long
    ridge of low and irregular hills, terminating at last in the enormous masses of
    Pennygent and Ingleborough,&mdash;its deep and secluded valleys, containing within
    their hoary ramparts of gray limestone fertile fields and pleasant
    pasturages,&mdash;its wide-spreading moors, covered with the different species of
    moss and ling, and fern and bent-grass, which variegate the brown livery of the
    heath, and break its sombre uniformity,&mdash;its crystal streams of unwearied
    rapidity, now winding a silent course "in infant pride" through the willows and
    sedges which fringe their banks, and now bounding with impetuous rage over the broken
    ledges of rock, which seek in vain to impede their progress from the
    mountains,&mdash;its indigenous woods of yew, and beech, and ash, and alder, which
    have waved in the winds of centuries, and which still flourish in green old age on
    the sides and summits of the smaller declivities,&mdash;its projecting crags, which
    fling additional gloom over the melancholy tarns that repose in dismal grandeur at
    their feet,&mdash;its hamlets, and towns, and ivy-mantled churches, which remind the
    visiter of their antiquity by the rudeness, and convince him of their durability by
    the massiveness of their construction,&mdash;these are all features in the landscape
    which require to be seen only once, to be impressed upon the recollection for ever.
    But it is not merely for the lovers of the wild, and beautiful, and picturesque, that
    the localities of Craven possess a powerful charm. The antiquarian, the novelist, and
    the poet, may all find rich store of employment in the traditions which are handed
    down from father to son respecting the ancient lords and inhabitants of the district.
    It is indeed the region of romance, and I have often felt surprise, that the
    interesting materials with which it abounds have so seldom been incorporated into the
    works of fiction which are now issuing with such thoughtless haste from the press of
    the metropolis. In Dr. Whitaker's History of Craven&mdash;which in spite of his
    extravagant prejudices in favour of gentle blood, and in derogation of commercial
    opulence, is still an excellent model for all future writers of local
    history&mdash;there is a ground-work laid for at least a dozen ordinary novels. To
    say nothing of the legendary tales, which the peasantry relate of the minor families
    of the district, of the Bracewells, the Tempests, the Lysters, the Romilies, and the
    Nortons,&mdash;whose White Doe, however, has been immortalized by the poetry of
    Wordsworth,&mdash;can any thing be more pregnant with romantic adventure than the
    fortunes of the successive chieftains of the lordly line of Clifford? Their first
    introduction to the North, owing to a love-match made by a poor knight of
    Herefordshire with the wealthy heiress of the Viponts and the Vesys! Their rising
    greatness, to the merited disgrace and death of Piers de Gavestone and his profligate
    minions! and their final exaltation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page75"
    name="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> to the highest honours of the British peerage, which
    they have now enjoyed for five hundred years, to the strong hand and unblenching
    heart with which they have always welcomed the assaults of their most powerful
    enemies! Of the first ten lords of Skipton castle, four died in the field and one
    upon the scaffold! The "black-faced Clifford," who sullied the glory which he
    acquired by his gallantry at the battle of Sandal, by murdering his youthful prisoner
    the Earl of Rutland, in cold blood, at the termination of it, has gained a passport
    to an odious immortality from the soaring genius of the bard of Avon. But his real
    fate is far more striking, both in a moral and in a poetical point of view, than that
    assigned to him by our great dramatist. On the evening before the battle of Towton
    Field, and after the termination of the skirmish which preceded it, an unknown archer
    shot him in the throat, as he was putting off his gorget, and so avenged the wretched
    victims, whose blood he had shed like water upon Wakefield Bridge. The vengeance of
    the Yorkists was not, however, satiated by the death of the Butcher, as Leland
    informs us that they called him:&mdash;for they attainted him, in the first year of
    the reign of Edward the Fourth, and granted his estates, a few years afterwards, to
    the Duke of Gloucester, who retained them in his iron grasp till he lost them with
    his crown and life at the battle of Bosworth. The history of his son is a romance
    ready made. His relations, fearing lest the partisans of the house of York should
    avenge the death of the young Earl of Rutland on the young Lord Clifford, then a mere
    infant, concealed him for the next twenty-five years of his life in the Fells of
    Cumberland, where he grew up as hardy as the heath on which he vegetated, and as
    ignorant as the rude herds which bounded over it. One of the first acts of Henry the
    Seventh, after his accession to the throne, was to reverse the attainder which had
    been passed against his father; and immediately afterwards the young lord emerged
    from the hiding place, where he had been brought up in ignorance of his rank, and
    with the manners and education of a mere shepherd. Finding himself more illiterate
    than was usual even in an illiterate age, he retired to a tower, which he built in
    the beautiful forest of Barden, and there, under the direction of the monks of Bolton
    Abbey, gave himself up to the forbidden studies of alchemy and astrology. His son,
    who was the first Earl of Cumberland, embittered the conclusion of his life, by
    embarking in a series of adventures, which, in spite of their profligacy, or rather
    in consequence of it, possess a very strong romantic interest. Finding that his
    father was either unwilling or unable to furnish him with funds to maintain his
    inordinate riot and luxury, he became the leader of a band of outlaws, and, by their
    agency, levied aids and benevolences upon the different travellers on the king's
    highway. A letter of the old lord, his father, which, by the by, is not the letter of
    an illiterate man, is still extant, in which he complains in very moving terms of his
    son's degeneracy and misconduct. The young scapegrace, wishing to make his father
    know from experience the inconvenience of being scantily supplied with money,
    enjoined his tenantry in Craven not to pay their rents, and beat one of them, Henry
    Popely, who ventured to disobey him, so severely with his own hand, that he lay for a
    long time in peril of death. He spoiled his father's houses, &amp;c. "feloniously
    took away his proper goods," as the old lord quaintly observes, "apparelling himself
    and his horse, all the time, in cloth of gold and goldsmith's work, more like a duke
    than a poor baron's son." He likewise took a particular aversion to the religious
    orders, "shamefully beating their tenants and servants, in such wise as some whole
    towns were fain to keep the churches both night and day, and durst not come at their
    own houses."&mdash;Whilst engaged in these ignoble practices, less dissonant,
    however, to the manners of his age than to those of our's, he wooed, and won, and
    married, a daughter of the Percy of Northumberland; and it is conjectured, upon very
    plausible grounds, that his courtship and marriage with a lady of the highest rank
    under such disadvantages on his part, gave rise to the beautiful old ballad of the
    Nutbrown Maid. The lady, becoming very unexpectedly the heiress of her family, added
    to the inheritance of the Cliffords the extensive fee which the Percies held in
    Yorkshire; and by that transfer of property, and by the grant of Bolton Abbey, which
    he obtained from Henry the Eighth, on the dissolution of the monasteries, her husband
    became possessor of nearly all the district which stretches between the castles of
    Skipton on the south, and of Brougham, or as the Cliffords, to whom it belonged,
    always wrote it, Bromeham, on the north. The second Earl of Cumberland, who was as
    fond of alchemy and astrology as his grandfather, was succeeded by his son George,
    who distinguished himself abroad by the daring intrepidity with which he conducted
    several buccaneering expeditions in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76"
    name="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> West Indies against the Spaniards, and at home, by
    the very extensive scale on which he propagated his own and his Maker's image in the
    dales of Craven. Among the numerous children of whom he was the father, the most
    celebrated was the Countess of Pembroke and Montgomery, whose long life of virtuous
    exertion renders her well qualified to figure as the heroine of a tale of chivalry.
    The anecdotes which are told of this high-spirited lady in the three counties of
    York, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, are almost innumerable, and relate to
    circumstances in her life, which, though some are impossible, and others improbable,
    are still all full of heroic interest and adventure. Her defence of Bromeham Castle
    against the intrusion of her uncle of Cumberland,&mdash;her riding cross-legged to
    meet the judges of assize, when she acted in person at Appleby as High Sheriff by
    inheritance of the county of Westmoreland,&mdash;her hairbreadth escapes and dangers
    during the great rebellion, are characteristics of the woman, so striking in
    themselves, that they would require little adventitious ornament from the writer, who
    should take them as incidents for poem or romance. Her courage and liberality in
    public life were only to be equalled by her order, economy, and devotion in private.
    "She was," says Dr. Whitaker, "the oldest and most independent courtier in the
    kingdom," at the time of her death.&mdash;"She had known and admired queen
    Elizabeth;&mdash; she had refused what she deemed an iniquitous award of king James,"
    though urged to submit to it by her first husband, the Earl of Dorset;&mdash; "She
    rebuilt her dismantled castles in defiance of Cromwell, and repelled with disdain the
    interposition of a profligate minister under Charles the Second." A woman of such
    dauntless spirit and conduct would be a fitting subject, even for the pencil of the
    mighty magician of Abbotsford. A journal of her life in her own hand-writing is still
    in existence at Appleby Castle. I have heard, that it descends to the minutest
    details about her habits and feelings, and that it is that cause alone, which
    prevents its publication.</p>

    <h3>A VILLAGE FUNERAL IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>

    <p>The sun was careering brightly in the heavens, and all nature was rejoicing in its
    unclouded glory, as the funeral procession of Helen Hartlington, and Antony Clifford,
    wound its toilsome and melancholy way to Bolton Abbey. The sportive Deer were
    bounding lightly over the hills, and the glad birds were warbling melodiously in the
    thickets, as if none but the living were moving amongst them; and but for the wild
    dirge, which mingled with the whispers of the wind, and but for the deep-toned knell
    which ever and anon rose slowly and mournfully above it, the lone traveller would
    never have conjectured that Death was conveying its victims through those smiling
    scenes. As the procession approached the portals of the Abbey, it was met, as was
    then customary, by the young men and maidens of the surrounding villages, in their
    best array, who hung upon the hearse chaplets of fragrant flowers, and strewed its
    path with rosemary, pansies, and rue. At the same moment the solemn chant of the
    Miserere thrilled upon the soul, and was succeeded, as it gradually melted into
    silence, by the still more affecting strains of the parting requiem for the
    dead&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.</p>

    <h2>NOTES FROM THE QUARTERLY REVIEW&mdash;(JUST PUBLISHED.)</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>An old acquaintance of ours, as remarkable for the grotesque queerness of his
    physiognomy, as for the kindness and gentleness of his disposition, was asked by a
    friend, where he had been? He replied, he had been seeing the lion, which was at that
    time an object of curiosity&mdash;(we are not sure whether it was <i>Nero</i> or
    <i>Cato</i>.) "And what," rejoined the querist, "did the lion think of you?" The jest
    passed as a good one; and yet under it lies something that is serious and true.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The possibility of a great change being introduced by very slight beginnings may
    be illustrated by the tale which Lockman tells of a vizier who, having offended his
    master, was condemned to perpetual captivity in a lofty tower. At night his wife came
    to weep below his window. "Cease your grief," said the sage; "go home for the
    present, and return hither when you have procured a live black-beetle, together with
    a little <i>ghee</i>, (or buffalo's butter.) three clews, one of the finest silk,
    another of stout packthread, and another of whip-cord; finally, a stout coil of
    rope."&mdash; When she again came to the foot of the tower, provided according to her
    husband's commands, he directed her to touch the head of the insect with a little of
    the <i>ghee</i>, to tie one end of the silk thread around him, and to place the
    reptile on the wall of the tower. Seduced by the smell of the butter, which he
    conceived to be in store somewhere above him, the beetle continued to ascend till he
    reached the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>
    top, and thus put the vizier in possession of the end of the silk thread, who drew up
    the packthread by means of the silk, the small cord by means of the packthread, and,
    by means of the cord, a stout rope capable of sustaining his own weight,&mdash;and so
    at last escaped from the place of his duresse.</p>

    <h3>ANOTHER UNIVERSITY.</h3>

    <p>A munificent lady in Yorkshire has recently offered to subscribe 50,000 <i>l</i>.
    towards the endowment of an university <i>in that county</i>, and a noble earl has
    professed his willingness to give a similar benefaction. These princely examples will
    no doubt be followed ere long, and the scheme completed&mdash;though we have some
    doubts whether the site of the new university for the north would be best selected in
    Yorkshire.</p>

    <p>Greater changes have taken place in no single age than are at this time in
    progress; and the revolutions in which empires, kingdoms, or republics are made and
    unmade, and political constitutions rise and burst like bubbles upon a standing pool,
    when its stagnant waters are disturbed by a thunder- shower, are not the most
    momentous of those changes, neither are they those which most nearly concern us. The
    effects of the discovery of printing could never be felt in their full extent by any
    nation, till education, and the diffusion also of a certain kind of knowledge, had
    become so general, that newspapers should be accessible to every body, and the very
    lowest of the people should have opportunity to read them, or to hear them read. The
    maxim that it is politic to keep the people in ignorance, will not be maintained in
    any country where the rulers are conscious of upright intentions, and confident
    likewise in the intrinsic worth of the institutions which it is their duty to uphold,
    knowing those institutions to be founded on the rock of righteous principles. They
    know, also, that the best means of preserving them from danger is so to promote the
    increase of general information, as to make the people perceive how intimately their
    own well-being depends upon the stability of the state, thus making them wise to
    obedience.</p>

    <p>The heart and mind can as little lie barren as the earth whereon we move and have
    our being, and which, if it produce not herbs and fruit meet for the use of man, will
    be overrun with weeds and thorns. Muley Ismael, a personage of tyrannical celebrity
    in his day, always employed his troops in some active and useful work, when they were
    not engaged in war, "to keep them," he said, "from being devoured by the worm of
    indolence." In the same spirit one of our Elizabethan poets delivered his wholesome
    advice:&mdash;</p>

    made among the cedars for the building of his temple, and his house of the forest of
    Lebanon! Many is the phlebotomist who, with this text in his mouth, has taken the rod
    in hand, when he himself, for ill teaching, or ill temper, or both, has deserved it
    far more than the poor boy who, whether slow of comprehension, or stupified by

    <h3>THE VISION OF VALDEMARO.</h3>

    <h4><i>Translated from the Spanish.</i></h4>

    <p>It was night; and by degrees, that sweet forgetfulness which suspends our
    faculties insensibly began to steal over me, and I fell asleep. In an instant my soul
    was transported to an unknown region. I found myself in the centre of a spacious
    plain, surrounded by groves of mournful cypresses. The whole enclosure was full of
    superb mausoleums, some assuming the shape of pyramids, whose lofty summits almost
    touched the clouds; and others the forms of altars, whose magnificence presented the
    most imposing spectacle. On all were engraved the epitaphs and sculptured insignia of
    the heroes who had been interred there. In various places I discovered coffins lying
    on the ground covered with sable palls, and bodies extended on the bare earth, meanly
    enveloped in miserable garbs.</p>

    <p>I wandered, filled with terror, through this dismal region. By the light of the
    moon, which shone in the midst of an unclouded sky, I attentively regarded these
    proud monuments, and curiosity impelled me to read the pompous epitaphs inscribed on
    them. "How remarkable a difference!" I observed to myself; "when ordinary men,
    incapable of eclipsing their fellow mortals, lie forgotten in dust and corruption,
    those great men who have excited astonishment and admiration throughout the world,
    even after the lapse <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>[pg
    78]</span> of many ages, still breathe in splendid marble! Happy are they who have
    had the glory of performing brilliant achievements! Even though inexorable fate
    refuse to spare them, their ashes afterwards revive, and under the very stroke of
    death, they rise triumphantly to a glorious immortality!"</p>

    <p>I was indulging in these reflections, when, on a sudden, a hoarse and fearful
    blast of wind affrighted me. The earth rocked under my feet, the mausoleum waved to
    and fro with violence, the cypresses were torn up with tremendous fury, and, from
    time to time, I heard a sound as of fleshless bones clashing together. In a moment,
    the heavens were covered with black clouds, and the moon withdrew her splendour. The
    horror inspired by the darkness of the night, and the dead silence which reigned
    amidst the tombs, caused my hair to stand on end, and stiffened my limbs until I had
    scarcely power to move them.</p>

    <p>In this dreadful situation, I saw an old man approaching me. His head was
    bald&mdash;his beard white&mdash;in his right hand he carried a crooked scythe, and
    in his left an hour-glass&mdash;whilst two immense flapping wings nearly concealed
    his body. "Thou," said he to me in a terrible voice, "who art still dazzled by the
    dignities and honours which mankind pursue with such reckless eagerness, see whether
    you perceive any difference between the dust of the monarch and that of the most
    wretched slave!" He spoke, and striking the ground a tremendous blow with his scythe,
    all these proud monuments fell headlong to the earth, and in an instant were reduced
    to dust. My terror was then redoubled, and my strength almost failed me. I could only
    perceive that there was no distinction. All was dust, corruption, and ashes. "Go,"
    said he, "seek another road to the temple of immortality! Behold the termination of
    those titles of grandeur which men so ardently desire! They vainly imagine that,
    after death, they shall survive in history, or in marbles, which shall leap emulously
    from their quarries to form such monuments of pride as you have just beheld; but they
    are miserably deceived; their existence ends at the instant they expire, and their
    fame, however deeply engraven on brass and marble, cannot have a longer duration than
    that of a brief moment when compared with eternity! I myself, TIME, consume and
    utterly annihilate all those structures which have vanity for their base; the works
    which are founded on virtue are not subject to my jurisdiction. They pass to the
    boundless regions of another world, and receive the reward of immortality!" With
    these words he disappeared.</p>

    <p>I awoke with a deadly dullness, and found that my sleep had been productive of
    instruction. Thenceforth I regarded, in a very different point of view, the pompous
    titles which before had dazzled me, and, by the aid of a little reflection, I soon
    became thoroughly sensible of their vanity.</p>

    <p>The Archduke Albert married the infanta Isabella, daughter of Philip II. king of
    Spain, with whom he had the Low Countries in dowry. In the year 1602, he laid siege
    to Ostend, then in possession of the heretics; and his pious princess, who attended
    him on the expedition, made a vow, that, till the city was taken, she would not
    change her clothes. Contrary to expectation, it was three years before the place was
    reduced; in which time her highness' linen had acquired a hue, which, from the
    superstition of the princess and the times, was much admired, and adopted by the
    court fashionables under the name of "Isabella colour." It is a yellow or soiled
    buff, better imagined than described.</p>

    <h3>FAMINE IN ENGLAND.</h3>

    <p>A severe dearth began in May, 1315, and proceeded to the utmost extremity, until
    after the harvest of 1316. In July, 1316, the quarter of wheat rose to 30<i>s</i>.,
    (equal to 22<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>.;) and in August reached to the enormous price of
    40<i>s</i>. or 30<i>l</i>. the quarter. A loaf of coarse bread, which was scarcely
    able to support a man for a single day, sold for 4<i>d</i>., equal in value to
    5<i>s</i>. now. Wheat rose in Scotland at one time to the enormous sum of
    100<i>s</i>. the quarter, equal to 75<i>l</i>. of the present currency. This dearth
    continued, but with mitigated severity, until after the harvest of 1317; but great
    abundance returned in 1318. This famine occasioned a prodigious mortality among the
    people, owing to the want of proper food, and employment of unwholesome substitutes.
    The rains set in so early in 1315, and continued so violently, that most of the seed
    of that year perished in the ground; the meadows were so inundated, that the hay crop
    of that year was utterly destroyed.</p>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> present day. Of
    its success two hundred years since, <i>E. S. N.</i> of Rochester, has sent us the
    following specimens:&mdash;</p>

    <p>At the end of an old medical book which I have in my possession, are the
    following, among other advertisements:&mdash;"<i>The new Plannet no Plannet</i> , or
    the Earth no <i>Wandring</i> Star. Here, out of the principles of divinity,
    philosophy, &amp;c. the earth's immobility is asserted, and <i>Copernicus</i>, his
    opinion, as erroneous, &amp;c. fully refuted, by <i>Alexander Ross</i>, in
    quarto."</p>

    <p>"<i>A Recantation of an Ill-led Life</i>, or a discovery of the highway law, as
    also many <i>cautelous</i> admonitions, and ful instructions how to know, shun, and
    apprehende a <i>thiefe</i>, most necessary for all honest travellers to peruse,
    observe, and practice; written by <i>John Clavel</i>, gent."</p>

    <h3>ENGLISH FASHIONS.</h3>

    <p>Our constant changes of habit were the subject of ridicule at home and abroad,
    even at an early period. Witness the ancient limner's jest in 1570, who, being
    employed to decorate the gallery of the Lord Admiral Lincoln with representations of
    the costumes of the different nations of Europe, when he came to the English, drew a
    naked man, with cloth of various colours lying by him, and a pair of shears held in
    his hand, as in rueful suspense and hesitation; or the earlier conceit, to the same
    effect, of "Andrew Borde of Physicke Doctor," alias "Andreas Perforatus," who, to the
    first chapter of his "Boke of the Instruction of Knowledge," (1542,) prefixed a naked
    figure, with these lines:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>"I am an Englishman, and naked I stande here,</p>

    <h3>THE TRAGEDY OF DOUGLAS.</h3>

    <p>It may not be generally known, that the first rehearsal of this tragedy took place
    in the lodgings in the Canongate, occupied by Mrs. Sarah Ward, one of Digges'
    company; and that it was rehearsed by, and in presence of, the most distinguished
    literary characters Scotland ever could boast of. The following was the cast of the
    piece on that occasion:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4"><i>Dramatis Personae.</i></p>

        <p class="i4"><i>Lord Randolph</i>, Dr. Robertson, Principal, Edinburgh.</p>

        <p class="i4"><i>Glenalvon</i>, David Hume, Historian.</p>

        <p class="i4"><i>Old Norval</i>, Dr. Carlyle, Minister of Musselburgh.</p>

        <p class="i4"><i>Douglas</i>, John Home, the Author.</p>

        <p class="i4"><i>Lady Randolph</i>, Dr. Fergusson, Professor.</p>

        <p class="i4"><i>Anna</i> (the maid), Dr. Blair, Minister, High Church.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The audience that day, besides Mr. Digges and Mrs. Sarah Ward, were the Right Hon.
    Pat. Lord Elibank, Lord Milton, Lord Kames, Lord Monboddo, (the two last were then
    only lawyers,) the Rev. John Steele, and William Home, ministers. The company (all
    but Mrs. Ward) dined afterwards at the Griskin Club, in the Abbey. The above is a
    signal proof of the strong passion for the drama which then obtained among the
    <i>literati</i> of this capital, since then, unfortunately, much abated. The
    rehearsal must have been conducted with very great secrecy; for what would the Kirk,
    which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> took such
    deep offence at the composition of the piece by one of its ministers, have said to
    the fact, of no less than four of these being engaged in rehearsing it, and two
    others attending the exhibition? The circumstance of the gentle Anna having been
    personated by "Dr. Blair, minister of the High Church," is a very droll
    one.&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Evening Post</i>.</p>

    <h3>THE CUMBERLAND LANDLORD.</h3>

    <h4><i>(To the Editor of the Mirror.)</i></h4>

    <p>During a recent excursion in Cumberland, I copied the following epitaph from the
    <i>album</i> kept at the inn at Pooley Bridge, the landlord of which is well known,
    as being quite an original:&mdash;W.W.</p>

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
